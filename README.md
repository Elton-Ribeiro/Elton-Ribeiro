### Hi there 👋

👦🏻 My name is Elton. <br>

👨‍💻 I’m interested in...
  - Software development;
  - Level up my coding skills;
  - Find bugs and contribute to open source projects; <br>  

🎺 My hobby is made 20% of cycling and 80% of music & audio electronics, modern and old stuff like vacuum tubes. (Yep! I know, wrong place to talk about!) <br>
