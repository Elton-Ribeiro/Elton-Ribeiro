### Hi there 👋


👦🏻 My name is Elton. <br>

👀 I’m interested in...
  - Software development;
  - Level up my coding skills;
  - Find bugs and contribute to open source projects; <br>  
  
👨‍💻 I’m currently studying Java, JavaScript, Typescript, Angular and Spring. <br>

🧱 I'll post here, some of my projects. <br>

🎺 My hobby is made 20% of cycling and 80% of music & audio electronics, modern and old stuff like vacuum tubes. (Yep! I know, wrong place to talk about!) <br>

<br>
That's it!<br>
